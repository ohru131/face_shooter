  <core_principles>
    1. **Over-the-top Cuteness**: Everything should be rounded, bouncy, and full of personality.
    2. **Vibrant & High Contrast**: Use a saturation-heavy palette to create excitement and energy.
    3. **Playful Chaos**: Elements should feel like they are bursting with energy, with lots of motion and squishy animations.
    4. **Mirror World**: The interface explicitly embraces the "mirror" concept with glossy reflections and symmetry.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Candy Store Explosion**: Bright pinks, electric blues, and sunny yellows against a soft pastel background. The goal is to evoke the feeling of a sugar rush—exciting, happy, and intense.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **The Sticker Book**: The UI elements float like stickers on a mirror. No rigid grids; instead, organic clusters of controls. The video feed is the "canvas" where the stickers live.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Bubble Borders**: Thick, rounded outlines on everything, often with a "shine" highlight.
    2. **Emoji-like Particles**: Missiles are hearts or stars; enemies are cute clouds or blobs with faces.
    3. **Wobbly UI**: Buttons and panels constantly have a gentle, jelly-like idle animation.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Squish & Pop**: Every interaction should feel tactile and elastic. Clicking a button should squash it flat before it pops back up. Opening mouth to shoot triggers a "pop" visual effect.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Spring Physics**: Heavy use of spring animations with high bounce. Things don't just appear; they boing into existence.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Rounded & Chunky**: Headings use a heavy, rounded sans-serif (like 'Fredoka One' or 'Varela Round'). Body text is clean but friendly (like 'Quicksand').
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Retro Arcade / 8-bit Pastel</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Nostalgic yet Soft**: Pixel art aesthetics but with a modern, soft color palette (no harsh neons).
    2. **Grid-based Fun**: While the game is fluid, the UI adheres to a chunky pixel grid.
    3. **Digital Glitch**: Cute glitch effects when enemies are hit or when the player takes damage.
    4. **Game Boy Cute**: Reminiscent of handheld consoles but in full color.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Pastel Pixel Dream**: Mint greens, lavender, and peach. Soft on the eyes but distinct enough for gameplay. Evokes a cozy, retro gaming session.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **The Arcade Cabinet**: The screen is framed like a cute, customized arcade cabinet. The video feed is the "screen" within the screen.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Pixel Hearts**: Health is represented by classic pixel hearts.
    2. **Scanlines (Subtle)**: A very faint overlay to give that CRT feel without reducing visibility.
    3. **Chunky Buttons**: UI buttons look like physical arcade buttons.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Clicky & Snappy**: Interactions have a "click" feel. Instant state changes rather than smooth morphs.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Frame-by-Frame**: Animations use stepped timing (e.g., 12fps) to mimic retro sprites, even if the game logic is 60fps.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Pixel Font**: A readable pixel font for all text (like 'Press Start 2P' or 'VT323'), paired with a monospaced font for data.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Y2K Cyber-Pop / Frutiger Aero</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Glossy & Translucent**: Glassmorphism with a pop twist. Shiny surfaces and gradients.
    2. **Futuristic Cute**: Robots, holograms, and digital pets.
    3. **Optimistic Tech**: Technology is friendly, helpful, and bright.
    4. **Fluidity**: Everything flows like water or liquid metal.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Holographic Rainbow**: Silver, cyan, and iridescent gradients. The colors shift as you move (simulated). Represents a bright, clean future.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **The HUD (Heads-Up Display)**: The UI elements are projected onto the "glass" of the screen, floating in 3D space around the user's face.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Glass Pills**: UI containers are capsule-shaped with heavy blur and white borders.
    2. **Lens Flares**: Subtle sparkles and flares on high-scoring actions.
    3. **Orbital Elements**: Things orbit around the user's head or the cursor.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Hover & Glow**: Elements glow intensely when interacted with. Smooth, laser-like precision.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Ease-in-out**: Very smooth, sweeping animations. No bounce, just elegant glides.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Wide Sans-Serif**: Extended sans-serif fonts (like 'Orbitron' or 'Montserrat' wide) for a techy feel.
  </typography_system>
